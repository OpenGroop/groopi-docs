# OpenGro/Op

## What is OpenGro/op?
In it's current incarnation, OpenGro/Op is an environment monitoring web application,
designed to run on a Raspbery Pi single board computer (RPi). OpenGro/Op takes incremtal environmental readings,
provided by external sensors, and saves the readings to a database, presenting a graph of historical environmental conditions.  
Put simply, a min/max meter on steroids.  
OpenGro/Op is a network appliance, and can be accessed by any device with a web browser.  
OpenGro/Op can provide low cost environmental insight that has previously not been accessible to indoor gardeners.

## What sensors are available?
Currently, there is one sensor model.  

- STHP *(tempurature, humidity, photocell)*

## What is next for OpenGro/Op?
In terms of hardware, a carbon dioxide (CO2), as well as a universal controller, are next in line.  
OpenGro/Op's next stage of development will be incorporating the universal controller
into the software design. We would like to be able to operate environmental control equipment
(vent fans, air conditioners, co2 solenoids, humidifiers) based off our readings.
